# Pipeline for Penguin Dataset

## Introduction
This project involves creating a pipeline for the penguins dataset, encompassing the data preparation process and training a new model. Additionally, the pipeline will be fine-tuned by selecting the best hyperparameters using validation subsets and a hyperparameter grid with the help of GridSearch.

### Pipeline Steps
1. **Data Preparation:** In this step, the dataset will undergo necessary preprocessing, including handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
2. **Model Training:** A machine learning model will be trained on the prepared dataset using the selected algorithm.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearch will be employed to systematically search through a hyperparameter grid, optimizing the model's performance based on validation subsets.
### Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for data preparation, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Library for building machine learning models and tools, including pipelines and GridSearch.
